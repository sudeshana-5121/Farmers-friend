		<img src="/media/accounts/images/linseed.jpeg" alt="linseed">

<p>	Linseed (Linum usitassimum L.) belongs to the family Linaceae and the genus Linum that has 100 species. Apart from cultivated L.usitassimum, five wild species in India have been reported. They are L.perenne, L.strictrum, L.mysorense, L.angustifolium and L.grandiflorum. It has been grown from ancient times for fibre (flax) and for its seed, which is rich in oil.Linseed is an annual herbaceous plant and grows to a height of 30 to 120 cm. Fibre types are tall growing and less branched than the seed types. It has a well-developed fibrous root system with many lateral roots. The stem is glabrous grayish green with leaves narrow and alternate. Fruit is a capsule, globular in shape mostly indehiscent. Seeds are compressed shinning yellow or light brown. The seed types with branching habit have less harvest index than the fibre types. In general harvest index varies from 0.19 to 0.31. The test weight is about 4.5 g/1,000 seeds. Number of capsules per unit area is the important yield component determining the yield and quality of linseed.</p>

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
    Synonyms</h2>
Linum crepitans (Boenn.) Dumort., Linum humile Mill., Linum usitatissimum var. humile (Mill.) Pers., Linum usitatissimum subsp. transitorium Vavilov & Elladi

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
Climate</h2>
Linseed is purely a cool season rabi crop. Temperate and cool climate conditions are best suited for growth. The minimum temperature regime is 10oC while the maximum is 38 oC. Thus, the main season for sowing linseed is October to November depending upon the availability of soil moisture.

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
Soil</h2>
Linseed is a cool season crop and requires moderate to cool temperature. It is grown best in well drained, fertile, medium and heavy soils especially silty loam, clay loam and silty clays. This crop is under cultivation in three ecosystems namely utera, rainfed and irrigated.

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
Varieties</h2>
In India, the linseed varieties are of two types: peninsular types, which have deep root system and alluvial types, which are shallow-rooted and are characterized by profuse tillering. There are number of varieties available for cultivation in different cropping systems, situations and for varied agro-climatic conditions in linseed. A considerable number of double purpose varieties have been developed which are having good seed and fiber yielding potentials. Varieties differ in maturity, growth habit, and seed size and colour. A few popular varieties are K-2, T-397, No.55, NP (RR) 9, S-4, Jawahar-17, Jawahar-7 (R-7), M-10, Mayurbhanj, LC 185, Hira, Mukta, Neelum, B-67, B.S.44 etc.

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
Seed treatment</h2>
Seed should be treated with Bavistin @ 1.5 g/kg seed or Thiram @ 3 g/kg seed orTopsin-M @ 2.5 g/kg seed to protect the crop from seed-borne diseases and to some extent from soil borne diseases also.

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Sowing</h2>
Thus, the main season for sowing linseed is October to November depending upon the availability of soil moisture. Early sowing helps the crop to escape attack of powdery mildew, rust and linseed bud fly in different regions. The crop takes 120 to 140 days to mature depending on the cultivar.

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Fertilizers</h2>
Depending on the soil type, about 40 kg P2O5 /ha is recommended for linseed. About K2O kg/ha is suggested. In the Indian subcontinent the general recommendations are 20 to 60 kg N, 10 to 30 kg P2O5 and 30 to 60 kg K2O per ha. The NPK demand of linseed is more at bud formation to peak flowering.

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Irrigation</h2>
<p>The oilseed crop needs about 25 to 30 oC during germination and vegetative phase and 15 to 20 oC during seed formation. An annual rainfall of 700 to 750 mm is optimum. Under dry climates irrigation is essential. A well-distributed rainfall of 450 to 500 mm can also suffice to grow good crop of linseed.</p>

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
Plant protection</h2>
Termite, cutworm, wireworm, semilooper, leaf minor, bud fly and gram pod borer infest the crop and cause considerable damage. The important diseases are wilt, alternaria blight and powdery mildew.

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
Cultivation</h2>
The soils most suitable for flax, besides the alluvial kind, are deep loams containing a large proportion of organic matter.[46] Flax is often found growing just above the waterline in cranberry bogs. Heavy clays are unsuitable, as are soils of a gravelly or dry sandy nature. Farming flax requires few fertilizers or pesticides. Within eight weeks of sowing, the plant can reach 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in) in height, reaching 70–80 cm (28–31 in) within 50 days

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
Distribution</h2>
Flax is thought to have originated from India and to have spread westwards following trade routes. It was brought to North America and Australia by colonization (Muir et al., 2003). Flax is possibly one of the first domesticated crops. It was grown and used for fibre, food and its medicinal properties from about 10,000 BCE in the Fertile Crescent. Linseed oil was first used as an oil painting preservative by the Flemish painter Jan van Eyck around 1400. The linoleum process, which used linseed oil to create durable floor covering, was patented in 1860 in England. Today flax is valued both for its industrial uses (oil and fibre) and for the potential health benefits of the seeds (Przybylski, 2005; Muir et al., 2003). 

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
    Processes </h2>
<p>Linseeds are small and hard seeds that when eaten are not crushed thoroughly by the grinding action of the teeth (Kohnke et al., 1999). This incomplete grinding limits the action of digestive enzymes, and thus the availability of the lipids to the animal (Raes et al., 2004). Raw linseeds contain cyanogenic substances (see Potential constraints on the "Nutritional aspects" tab) that are released in the presence of water, but they can be destroyed by high temperatures (Brunschwig et al., 2010). For these reasons, mechanical processing (crushing, grinding) and heat treatments (boiling, rolling, extrusion) are recommended to improve the nutritive value of linseeds.The co-extrusion or blending of linseeds with other grains, seeds and by-products (oil meals, bran) is commercially done to create products that are easier to process and store than linseeds extruded alone, due to a lower amount of released oil and a higher nutritive value (Brunschwig et al., 2010; Thacker et al., 2004; Htoo et al., 2008; Beaulieu et al., 2010).</p>

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Disease</h2>
<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"></h2>
<p>1.Rust - Melampsora lini</p>
<p>2.Fusarium Wilt - Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini</p>
<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Management</h2>
<p>1.Destruction of plant debris from the diseased field.
    • Seed treatment with Oxycarboxin.
    • Spray of fungicides like oxathin derivatives, Dithane M-45, Cuman L.</p>
<p>2.Crop rotation of at least 3 years.
    Seed treatment with Thiram or carbendazim@ 2.5g/kg seed.
    Soil drenching with Carbendaazim @ 0.1 % or COC@ 0.25%</p>
<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
Harvesting</h2>
<p>Crop should be harvested by sickle when the leaves are dry, the capsules have turned brown and seeds become shiny.</p>

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
Yield</h2>
<p>Rainfed condition – 800-1000 kg/ha
    Irrigated condition – 1600-2000 kg/ha
    Protective irrigated condition – 1200-1500 kg/ha</p>
